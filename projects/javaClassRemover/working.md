# The reason why the code works

### The reason why the code works despite deleting its own .class file during runtime is because the program is executed in memory, not from the actual .class files on disk. When you run a Java program, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) loads the byte code of the program into memory and executes it from there.

- ### Here's what happens step-by-step: 

- 1. You compile the Java source code file (`deleteClassFile.java`) into a .class file (`deleteClassFile.class`) using the Java compiler (`javac`). This .class file is stored on the disk.

- 2. When you run the Java program using the `java` command (`java deleteClassFile`), the JVM loads the `deleteClassFile.class` file into memory.

- 3. Once the program is loaded into memory, it operates independently of the .class file on disk. Any modifications or deletions to the .class file on disk won't affect the program's execution because it's already loaded into memory.

- 4. During the program's execution, when the code iterates through the list of files, including the current .class file (`deleteClassFile.class`), and deletes .class files with the `.delete()` method, it only affects the files on the disk, not the already loaded program in memory.

- So, the program can successfully delete all the .class files (except itself) from the current working directory and its subdirectories during runtime without any issue because the execution is entirely in memory. The program is not executed directly from the .class files on the disk after they are loaded into memory by the JVM.

- To summarize, the program works because it operates on files on the disk, not on the files already loaded in memory for execution.
